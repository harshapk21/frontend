 * read about time complexities of set , map and object lookups in js

/**
 * see if u can sort , will it help ???
 * observe pattern , like increasing / decreasing order
 * initialisation is imp , keep things simple and you can initialise out of box
 * sacrifice initial elements for later benefits for cases like 2sum and 4 sum etc
 * think if we can use hashmap or set , it helps in lots of cases
